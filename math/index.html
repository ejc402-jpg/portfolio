                <h2>Picard-Lindelöf Theorem - October 31st, 2025</h2>
                <p>We couldn't possibly skip over this fundamental theorem.</p>
                <p>Consider the initial value problem (IVP)</p>

                    <img src="picard1.png">
                </figure>
                <p>If f is continuous in a region containing <img src="picard2.png"> and is <b>Lipschitz continuous in the second variable</b> y on that region, then the IVP has a <b>unique</b> solution in some interval around <img src="picard3.png"></b></p>
                <h3>Interpretation</h3>
                <p>The theorem ensures that a differential equation with sufficiently well-behaved dynamics produces a single trajectory through each initial point. In other words, given an initial condition, the system evolves in a deterministic and predictable way.</p>
                <h3>Relevance</h3>
                <p>This theorem forms the theoretical foundation for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Existence and uniqueness of solutions to differential equations</li>
                    <li>Numerical methods such as Picard iteration</li>
                    <li>Stability and determinism in dynamical systems</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If the Lipschitz condition fails, existence may remain but uniqueness can be lost; multiple solution curves might pass through the same initial point.</p>

                <h2>Lipschitz Functions, Continuity and Constant - October 24th, 2025</h2>
                <p>A function <img src="lipschitz1.png"> is said to satisfy a <b>Lipschitz Condition</b> on D if there exists a constant L > 0 such that</p>

                </figure>
                <p>The constant L is called a <b>Lipschitz Constant</b> for f. D is the established domain (possible points) the function under a specified context is define on. Lipschitz continuity is stronger than ordinary continuity in that it adds more stipulations to the function's rate of change progression. Intuitively, it restricts how fast a function can change: the function cannot grow faster than a line with slope L.</p>
                <h3>Relevance</h3>
                <p>Lipschitz continuity plays an important role in guaranteeing the uniqueness
of solutions to differential equations. In machine learning and optimization,
Lipschitz constraints help ensure stable training, improve robustness to noise,
and control gradient explosion.</p>

                <h2>The Truth Behind Video Game Dice-Based Mechanics - September 5th, 2025</h2>
                <p>
                    As a long time fanatic and enjoyer of Nintendo multiplayer party games—particularly the original Wii series in <i>Mario Party 8</i> and <i>Wii Party</i>—I’ve always appreciated how game fundamentals like simple controls, quality minigames, and personalized competition work together to create a timeless experience every time you boot up the console. One possible explanation for their success is the balance between skill and “luck”, the presence of unpredictable game elements that change the dynamics of games like that. However, this aspect of these games is something that has endured much speculation and scrutiny since their releases, fueling game theorists’ paychecks for years! That is, whether the game’s dice rolls are truly randomized, or are pre-programmed combinations designed to materialize by seemingly random chance. Beyond the typical sore-loser coping about consecutively terrible rolls, there seems to be real merit behind discussing real, gameplay-affecting implications of manufactured dice rolls. By taking a deeper dive into the probabilistic nature of these party games, we’ll be able to better understand multiplayer design and see if our favorite childhood games have been selling us a lie all along.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A notorious discrepancy in the online gaming forum space is <i>Wii Party</i>’s roll-off feature. If two or more players tie in a minigame (either by numerical score or simultaneous elimination/victory), they go to a subsequent roll-off where their placements are dictated by a single dice value. Oddly enough, it’s impossible to tie in this cutscene, as the game is not programmed to handle loops in this area. That means if another opponent rolls first and lands a six, you automatically lose a placement to that player. Thus, the logical takeaway from this fact is to always make sure you roll your dice first to potentially get a six, nullifying your opponent’s roll entirely. However, this is merely an illusory advantage. If we consider six unique possible outcomes of your dice roll that cannot be repeated, rolling first gives you a chance to receive any of the six values, but the second roller now has five possible values to roll. If we go over every combination achievable:
                </p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="/portfolio/rollvalues.png", alt="probability table for dice roll-offs">
                    <figcaption>The number of values the second player can roll to beat the first player based on their roll</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    Adding these up gives you a total of fifteen scenarios where the second player wins the roll-off. Given that there are thirty possible roll outcomes for the first and second player (C(6, 1) * C(5, 1) = 30), this means that the long run probability that either player beats each other in the roll-off is 0.5, regardless of which player rolled first. Realistically then, there is no statistical benefit to ensuring your dice rolls before your opponent. The perceived advantage stems more from a psychological bias of rolling that six first. Nonetheless, a real concern lies in whether the dice roll values are predetermined by the game before you even roll, negating the probabilities associated with the rolls of the players before you. If game results feel random but are actually confined to hidden rules, how can we trust that the dice are indeed rolling fairly?
                </p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-1JCDPrCAto/hq720.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEhCK4FEIIDSFryq4qpAxMIARUAAAAAGAElAADIQj0AgKJD&rs=AOn4CLCGyMVBJYU549BfO94ZWUL6Fn-IJw" alt="wii party roll-off dice screen">

                </figure>
                <p>Simply put, the Wii consoles are physically incapable of modeling true unpredictability. Implementing such processes would be too costly for Nintendo to carry out for a project that entered the massively growing gaming market in 2006. Game developers also need reproducibility in their code, and including truly random elements could be a debugging disaster when millions of copies would be sold. Turns out, <i>Wii Party</i> has a unique approach to fostering randomness in their game features. It uses a <u>pseudo-random number generator, or PRNG</u>, a deterministic algorithm with an initial seed value that produces an already generated sequence of possible numbers. Each scenario in the game has specific pairs of dice with a limited number of combinations, and the unique seeds tell the program to select a random pair from that list. The seed’s algorithm produces numbers in a sequence that is predefined and finite, essentially becoming “controlled randomness”.</p>
                <p>Yet, the seed logic works in a way to foster chance at work in the game, but prevents streaks of bad luck from ruining a player’s experience. While a predetermined set of outcomes may seem as good as truly random dice as long as all combinations have an equal chance of being picked, the sequence itself is often manufactured to outlaw extreme outliers (like rolling double ones six times in a row). This is a classic game design mechanic called <b>rubber-banding</b>. Players who are particularly struggling and dwelling towards the last place will inconspicuously receive small advantages to gameplay to facilitate “artificial comebacks”. Seeing it this way, it means that dice rolls are actually not independent of each other. The PRNG takes previous rolls and in-game factors such as stage in the game and how far the players are from each other and from winning, and avoids improbable streaks that inevitably frustrate players and disrupt the game’s pacing. For example, a player in last place might be rolling terribly, but will suddenly roll incredibly well to land on certain spaces that provide game-changing benefits. It’s made even more evident when the last place player is allowed to select the upcoming minigames for earning better dice rolls when the game reaches a certain point near the end, as a way to help the player catch up. Psychologically, it’s encouraging for casual players constantly overshadowed by technically superior opponents, and disheartening for serious players being dealt bad hands by design. Of course, the game is built to make these adjustments subtle, and most of the time, they largely don’t affect the end game results for players. But, they do just enough to keep the competition tension alive, ensuring that every player continues to have a positive, and more importantly, “fair” experience.</p>

                    <figcaption>A player rolling the lowest possible combination of dice (rolling double-ones grants a third dice)</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>The controversy surrounding these dice-rolling mechanics derives from a broader clash between perception and reality. On one side, PRNG’s and rubber-banding techniques maintain the engagement levels and prevent strokes of bad luck from ruining the fun. On the other hand, knowledge that the dice are secretly being rigged raises concerns about the game’s integrity, and possibly deters players from a skill-based experience. Being that Nintendo’s mission is to put smiles on all types of people who play their games, it makes sense for them to take on this approach to multiplayer party games, a huge portion of their brand’s identity. Ultimately, by luck, skill, or a little behind-the-scenes magic from Nintendo, these games do keep players engaged and smiling—a design triumph disguised as chaos.</p>
