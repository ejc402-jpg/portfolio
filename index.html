            <p>Hi there, I'm Eric, a rising second year Applied Mathematics and Computer Science student at UCLA.
                Unlike many colleagues at my university, I did not have an extensive upbringing in math competitions and programming contests. However, I'm passionate to learn about
                new technologies, tackle problems, and build cool stuff along the way!<br><br>
                This website is poorly structured and will be refined at a later time as I am currently working on a predictive modeling project for the 2025 BWF Badminton World Championships,
                which is set to occur on Monday, August 25th!
            </p>
            <h2>Stuff I'm Currently Working On/Interested In</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>predictive model analyzing player stats, head-to-head matchups, venue performance, and draws to craft the ultimate pick'ems for the 2025 BWF World Championships</li>
                <li>a fitness app that personalizes exercise selection based on training modality, and a simple macronutrient tracker and AI-powered diet coach. Inspired by Renaissance Periodization and MacroFactor.</li>
                <li>music discovery platform that recognizes music taste based on entered songs and recommends similar tracks based on genre, duration, timbre, etc.
                    Inspired by <a href="https://www.chosic.com/playlist-generator/">similar song finder</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Stuff That I Want To Learn/Build Later</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>interactive platform to help model/visualize concepts such as 
                    vector theory, multivariable calculus, line & surface integrals, linear algebra, and differential equations to help bridge the gap between theory and practical knowledge. 
                    Synonymous with UCLA's lower-division MATH 32-33 series curriculum.
                </li>
                <li>
                    stochastic processes, particularly monte carlo methods and markov chains, as they pertain to quantitative finance and financial modeling
                </li>
            </ul>
