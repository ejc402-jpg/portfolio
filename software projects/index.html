                <p>In high school, weekends meant time off for relaxation, family, friends, and most importantly, an opportunity to pursue one's own agenda and passions. Mine were spent drafting APUSH outlines and AP Psych module notes, both completely irrelevant to what I'm studying now.
                Looking back, I would have definitely benefitted professionally and physically from developing efficient studying techniques early on; something I have yet to perfect in university.
                In terms of those trendy "study with me" live streams and video recordings, I never seemed to thrive under stratified, time-intensive studying blocks. It felt rushed, yet disruptive if a break were taken when momentum was building up</p>
                <p>But with college demanding higher quality work and responsibilities of adulting creeping in, it's imperative to find ways to cut down revision time while still consistently performing high outputs. 
                    This upcoming year, I'm revisiting these studying techniques in hopes of actually achieving the objective of efficient studying.

                <h2>The Truth Behind Video Game Dice-Based Mechanics - September 5th, 2025</h2>
                <p>
                    As a long time fanatic and enjoyer of Nintendo multiplayer party games—particularly the original Wii series in <i>Mario Party 8</i> and <i>Wii Party</i>—I’ve always appreciated how game fundamentals like simple controls, quality minigames, and personalized competition work together to create a timeless experience every time you boot up the console. One possible explanation for their success is the balance between skill and “luck”, the presence of unpredictable game elements that change the dynamics of games like that. However, this aspect of these games is something that has endured much speculation and scrutiny since their releases, fueling game theorists’ paychecks for years! That is, whether the game’s dice rolls are truly randomized, or are pre-programmed combinations designed to materialize by seemingly random chance. Beyond the typical sore-loser coping about consecutively terrible rolls, there seems to be real merit behind discussing real, gameplay-affecting implications of manufactured dice rolls. By taking a deeper dive into the probabilistic nature of these party games, we’ll be able to better understand multiplayer design and see if our favorite childhood games have been selling us a lie all along.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A notorious discrepancy in the online gaming forum space is <i>Wii Party</i>’s roll-off feature. If two or more players tie in a minigame (either by numerical score or simultaneous elimination/victory), they go to a subsequent roll-off where their placements are dictated by a single dice value. Oddly enough, it’s impossible to tie in this cutscene, as the game is not programmed to handle loops in this area. That means if another opponent rolls first and lands a six, you automatically lose a placement to that player. Thus, the logical takeaway from this fact is to always make sure you roll your dice first to potentially get a six, nullifying your opponent’s roll entirely. However, this is merely an illusory advantage. If we consider six unique possible outcomes of your dice roll that cannot be repeated, rolling first gives you a chance to receive any of the six values, but the second roller now has five possible values to roll. If we go over every combination achievable:
                </p>
                <figure>

                    <figcaption>The number of values the second player can roll to beat the first player based on their roll</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    Adding these up gives you a total of fifteen scenarios where the second player wins the roll-off. Given that there are thirty possible roll outcomes for the first and second player (C(6, 1) * C(5, 1) = 30), this means that the long run probability that either player beats each other in the roll-off is 0.5, regardless of which player rolled first. Realistically then, there is no statistical benefit to ensuring your dice rolls before your opponent. The perceived advantage stems more from a psychological bias of rolling that six first. Nonetheless, a real concern lies in whether the dice roll values are predetermined by the game before you even roll, negating the probabilities associated with the rolls of the players before you. If game results feel random but are actually confined to hidden rules, how can we trust that the dice are indeed rolling fairly?

                </figure>
                <p>Simply put, the Wii consoles are physically incapable of modeling true unpredictability. Implementing such processes would be too costly for Nintendo to carry out for a project that entered the massively growing gaming market in 2006. Game developers also need reproducibility in their code, and including truly random elements could be a debugging disaster when millions of copies would be sold. Turns out, <i>Wii Party</i> has a unique approach to fostering randomness in their game features. It uses a <u>pseudo-random number generator, or PRNG</u>, a deterministic algorithm with an initial seed value that produces an already generated sequence of possible numbers. Each scenario in the game has specific pairs of dice with a limited number of combinations, and the unique seeds tell the program to select a random pair from that list. The seed’s algorithm produces numbers in a sequence that is predefined and finite, essentially becoming “controlled randomness”.</p>
                <p>Yet, the seed logic works in a way to foster chance at work in the game, but prevents streaks of bad luck from ruining a player’s experience. While a predetermined set of outcomes may seem as good as truly random dice as long as all combinations have an equal chance of being picked, the sequence itself is often manufactured to outlaw extreme outliers (like rolling double ones six times in a row). This is a classic game design mechanic called <b>rubber-banding</b>. Players who are particularly struggling and dwelling towards the last place will inconspicuously receive small advantages to gameplay to facilitate “artificial comebacks”. Seeing it this way, it means that dice rolls are actually not independent of each other. The PRNG takes previous rolls and in-game factors such as stage in the game and how far the players are from each other and from winning, and avoids improbable streaks that inevitably frustrate players and disrupt the game’s pacing. For example, a player in last place might be rolling terribly, but will suddenly roll incredibly well to land on certain spaces that provide game-changing benefits. It’s made even more evident when the last place player is allowed to select the upcoming minigames for earning better dice rolls when the game reaches a certain point near the end, as a way to help the player catch up. Psychologically, it’s encouraging for casual players constantly overshadowed by technically superior opponents, and disheartening for serious players being dealt bad hands by design. Of course, the game is built to make these adjustments subtle, and most of the time, they largely don’t affect the end game results for players. But, they do just enough to keep the competition tension alive, ensuring that every player continues to have a positive, and more importantly, “fair” experience.</p>

                    <figcaption>A player rolling the lowest possible combination of dice (rolling double-ones grants a third dice)</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>The controversy surrounding these dice-rolling mechanics derives from a broader clash between perception and reality. On one side, PRNG’s and rubber-banding techniques maintain the engagement levels and prevent strokes of bad luck from ruining the fun. On the other hand, knowledge that the dice are secretly being rigged raises concerns about the game’s integrity, and possibly deters players from a skill-based experience. Being that Nintendo’s mission is to put smiles on all types of people who play their games, it makes sense for them to take on this approach to multiplayer party games, a huge portion of their brand’s identity. Ultimately, by luck, skill, or a little behind-the-scenes magic from Nintendo, these games do keep players engaged and smiling—a design triumph disguised as chaos.</p>

                <h2>A Statistical Approach to the BWF World Championships - September 2nd, 2025</h2>
                <p>Badminton is a widely popular racket sport around the globe, both recreationally and competitively. However, due to the multitude of factors such as arena drift, player head-to-heads, strategy, and other game dynamics, professional play is often unpredictable to the standard viewer.
                </p>
                <p>Particularly with the 2025 BWF World Championships kicking off as I'm writing this, many online badminton enthusiasts are making their bold predictions for who will ultimately lift the trophies and become world champions for their country. However, can looking at pure empirical statistics be a viable method for reliably predicting tournament outcomes? Or are there factors off the court that affect gameplay, but cannot be properly represented through data?
                </p>
                <p>This project aims to cultivate a more meticulous method of analyzing professional badminton tournamanets, understanding what most winners have in common, and be able to apply these concepts to their own matches or other competitive undertakings.
                </p>
                <p>We can also use these findings to determine which factors ultimately influence match outcomes the most and utilize certain machine learning techniques to craft some (hopefully accurate) power rankings 2025 BWF World Championships. We won't necessarily be able to predict match outcomes based on the actual tournament draw (which could be a potentially bigger project on its own), but we should be able to see which players could be a true threat at the World Championships this year, based on current yearly stats and previous World Championship outcomes.
