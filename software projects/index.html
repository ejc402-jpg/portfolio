                <p>Ever wanted to communicate plain English with your hands, but too cool for ASL? This short computer vision project uses MediaPipe to track signals made by your hands to convert to English text!</p>
                <p>Despite the woefully slow processing, it was a cool project to work on image detection</p>

                <h2>Basic Pomodoro App with Adjustable Timer - September 9th, 2025</h2>
                <p>In high school, weekends meant time off for relaxation, family, friends, and most importantly, an opportunity to pursue one's own agenda and passions. Mine were spent drafting APUSH outlines and AP Psych module notes, both completely irrelevant to what I'm studying now.
                Looking back, I would have definitely benefitted professionally and physically from developing efficient studying techniques early on; something I have yet to perfect in university.
                In terms of those trendy "study with me" live streams and video recordings, I never seemed to thrive under stratified, time-intensive studying blocks. It felt rushed, yet disruptive if a break were taken when momentum was building up</p>
                <p>But with college demanding higher quality work and responsibilities of adulting creeping in, it's imperative to find ways to cut down revision time while still consistently performing high outputs. 
                    This upcoming year, I'm revisiting these studying techniques in hopes of actually achieving the objective of efficient studying. 
                </p>
